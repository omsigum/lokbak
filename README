Inoreder to run the note api you must have a running Mysql/mariadb server.
Also add a file called conf.py, it looks like:
class conf:
        def __init__(self):
                self.dbpass = "DATABASEPASSWORD"
                self.dbusername = "DATABASEUSERNAME"
                self.dbhost = "HOSTNAME"
                self.dbase  = "DATABASENAME"
